    "# Gender-Pay Gap and Lack of Fit\n",
    "It's no secret that there is a gender-pay gap across many industries. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the western world, women began entering the workforce in or around the 1970s, when a single income could no longer sufficiently provide for a middle-class family [[1]](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/women-in-the-workforce-wh_b_4462455). The driving factor at this point was an economic need rather than a consideration of what women could contribute, and unfortunately, not all occupations were open to women. Presumably, because women were restricted and undervalued by society, they restricted and undervalued themselves. The leading occupations for women in 1970 were secretaries, bookkeepers, and elementary school teachers. The fact that these positions were paid less than the leading occupations for men in the 70s: entry-level managers, truck drivers, or production supervisors, seemed obvious [[1]](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/women-in-the-workforce-wh_b_4462455). \n",
    "\n",
    "With the tech sector becoming an increasingly dominant industry over the past two decades [[2]](https://vincentbenjamin.com/tech-timeline-a-brief-history-of-the-information-technology-industry/) - five decades since women began joining the workforce - one would think that the tech industry wouldn't be slighted towards male or female employees. However, according to diversity reports published by 11 of the world's largest tech companies in 2014, **the average percentage of women working in the tech industry was about 30%, despite women making up over 50% of the workforce in most western countries** [[3]](https://www.cnet.com/news/women-in-tech-the-numbers-dont-add-up/). Within that 30% of female employees, women occupied anywhere from 10-17% of in technical positions and 21-26% percent of leadership positions in Microsoft, Twitter and Google [[3]](https://www.cnet.com/news/women-in-tech-the-numbers-dont-add-up/).     \u000b",
    "  \n",
    "These numbers can be largely attributed to our unconscious biases towards males in most industries, despite women holding more degrees than men in the US, UK, and Canada [5,7]. According to a global online study, **76% of 200,000 participants see men as better suited as career professionals and women as homemakers** [[4]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/break-the-future/2016/12/20/think-youre-not-biased-against-women-at-work-read-this/). This is often referred to by academics as the lack of fit principle, which occurs when there is a discrepancy between what a someone is thought to be like and what is thought to be required for success. These presumptions are often based on gender, and requirements for success are often attributed to perceived male-like traits, such as agency [[5], [[6]](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1211286109)]. These biases are consistently proven to be echoed throughout hiring and evaluative processes of organizations, universities and even orchestras [[5], [[6]](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1211286109)], and they lead to women in what are traditionally, and perhaps unconsciously, thought to be male-like professions, such as science, technology, engineering, math and management, being underestimated, devalued and consequently, underpaid. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to corporations and organizations undervaluing women, women may also undervalue themselves. A Hewlett Packard internal report suggested that **men will apply for a job even when they meet only 60% of the qualifications, but women will only apply if they meet 100% of them** [[8]](https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified).\n",

    "* For example, you can see that female data scientists in the US are paid 124K annually, while their male counterparts receive 146K. In India, a male data analyst receives 16.7K and his female counterpart receives 4.2K. In the UK, a female software engineer makes 47.5K and her male counterpart makes 90.8K.  \n",
    "* There are a few exceptions to men making less than or equal to the salaries of women, such as software engineers in China, and data analysts in Germany, but these figures may be skewed due to low numbers of respondents in these areas.\n",
    "* Canada seems to have the lowest gender-wage gap between male and female data scientists and data analysts; however, there are still significant gaps for software engineers, research scientists and business analysts.\n",
    "* Overall, we can see that men do not necessarily have higher salaries because they're employed in higher-value positions. Even when men are employed in positions that are commonly occupied by women, they make more than their female counterparts, and when women occupy positions than are commonly occupied by men, they continue to make less than their male counterparts. \n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "* In conclusion, survey data suggests that there are significantly less females than males in the DS & ML industry, with 16.6% female and 83.4% male respondents. The average percentage of female survey respondents in one country is 16.6%, with percentages ranging from 4-48% across the world.\n",
    "* Globally speaking, female survey respondents are more educated than their male counterparts, although males are more likely to have more coding experience. \n",
    "* In most occupations, higher percentages of women (3-17%) possess a higher level education than their male counterparts, and men are more likely to be able to enter into DS with a lower level of education than women.\n",
    "* Women are more likely to be students, data analysts, business analysts, unemployed, or statisticians and men are more likely to be data scientists, software engineers, product/project managers, data engineers and database engineers. \n",
    "* When comparing the average salaries of males and females globally, it is not uncommon to see men's salaries doubling women's in the same country.\n",
    "* Upon further investigation of male and female salaries by occupation, we can see that men's high salaries are not necessarily attributed to them occupying higher-value positions. More often than not, men in DS & ML typically bring home a higher salary than women in the same occupation and country. \n",
    "* These findings underscore the common, and likely unconscious, belief that men's contributions are seen to be more valuable than women's.
